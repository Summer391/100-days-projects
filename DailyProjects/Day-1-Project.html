            <p><strong>Boozhoo gakina anishinaabeg! Apegish mino-ayaayan gaye apegish minwendamaan gidagindaas o'ow mazina'igan.</strong></p>
            <p> Hello everyone! I hope that you're well and that you enjoy reading this page.</p>
            <br> 
            <h2> Overview/Introduction</h2>
                <p><strong>Boozhoo, Niibin nindizhinikaaz. Migizi nindoodem. Gichi-mookomaan-aki nindaa. Ningichi-baapinakamigiz ji-maajii-nanda-gikendamaan. O'ow mazina'igan ayaa akawe mazina'igan.</strong></p>
                <p> Hello, I'm Summer/Niibin. I'm from the eagle clan and I live in the U.S. I'm very excited to start learning this. This page is the first page I've made. </p>
            <br>
                <p>I'm a nerdy trans gal who loves match, science, and most recently, coding! I was recommended to try coding through chatgpt. I really needed a new hobby so this seemed like the perfect thing to pick up!</p>
                <p>In real life, I'm not too particularly interesting atm, but my online personality is everything! <em>(Oh, I did set 2 academic records for my school though!)</em></p>
            <h2>About Me/Hobbies/Interests/Passions</h2>
                <p>I have quite a few "nerdy" hobbies, like:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Cubing/Speedcubing</li>
                    <li>Math/Science/Coding (coding is a new hobby for me :D)</li>
                    <li>Reading just about anything nonfiction/informative/educational</li>
                    <li>Studying foreign languages (especially Ojibwe)</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>I also have "regular" hobbies like gaming and talking to people</p>
                <p><em>Fun fact, Ojibwe is my most studied language, because it was supposed to be my native language as I'm native american. I also live on a reservation, so ask me about that and I'll talk up a storm!</em></p>
            <h2>Skills/Things I'm Good At</h2>
            <p>I have various skill levels across all of my hobbies. Here's an overview (ask me for more if ya want :P):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cubing/Speedcubing:</strong> I use the CFOP method and I average around 30-25 seconds</li>
                <li><strong>Match/Science/Coding:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Math: I'm pretty scattered with my level, with holes in my knowledge that I'm trying to fall (all falling below calc 2 level, Math-wise, I'm scattered everywhere, but not more than like a calc 2 level; think series, polar equations, basic DE's, methods of integration, etc for calc 2)</li>
                        <li>Science: I have to get started completely with it ngl, I do know a thing or 2 here and there, but overall, I'm a beginner, so I'll be studying basic physics hopefully soon.</li>
                        <li>Coding: I just started coming from a lack of knowledge of how computers, the internet, or much of anything of that worked!</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Reading:</strong> I can't really read that fast but I can pick apart texts well, and my knowledge of things depends on what category of knowledge we're talking about :P</li>
                <li><strong>Foreign Languages:</strong> I'd say I'm intermediate level in Ojibwe, and for other languages, my main one is Spanish. I'm at the level of a  baby blurting their first sensible sentences out loud in Spanish. I also study other languages but rarely.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Portfolio/Work</h2>
            <p> I don't have much to put here atm, though I could put this page here because this is my first ever "real" coding project I finished.</p>

            <p>I've only graduated high school recently (Class of 2024! :D), and my plans for college atm are still in development. If I do go, I only have a slightly narrowed down list of things to study.</p>
            <p>This is also my first coding project I've ever done outside of old roblox things back in like 2019/2020.</p>
